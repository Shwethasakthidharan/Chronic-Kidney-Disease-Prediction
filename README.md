# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction

The **Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction** project aims to predict the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an impressive **98% accuracy** using machine learning algorithms. The project follows a structured process, starting with **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset's structure and identify patterns. **Data Preprocessing** steps include handling missing values, removing outliers, and scaling features for consistency. Categorical data is transformed using various **Feature Encoding** techniques like Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding. Multiple classification models are then trained, including **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **AdaBoost**, **Gradient Boosting**, **Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB)**, **XGBoost**, **CatBoost**, **Extra Trees**, and **LightGBM (LGBM)**. Each model is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and the best performing model is selected for final use. With **98% accuracy**, this model can be effectively deployed in healthcare settings for early diagnosis and prediction of chronic kidney disease.
